# Silent-Auction Game

This Python program simulates a Silent Auction, where multiple participants can place secret bids, and the highest bidder wins.

Features:

✔️ Multiple Participants: Allows multiple users to place their bids.

✔️ Silent Bidding: The screen is cleared after each bid (for Windows users) to keep bids private.

✔️ Automatic Winner Selection: Finds the highest bid and declares the winner.

✔️ User-Friendly Interface: Provides clear prompts and instructions.

How It Works:

1. The program welcomes users to the Silent Auction.
   
3. Each participant enters their name and bid amount.
   
5. After each bid, the program asks if there are any more bidders:
   
   a. If yes, the screen clears, keeping previous bids hidden.
   
   b. If no, the highest bidder is determined.
   
7. The program displays the winner's name and highest bid.
   
9. The auction ends when there are no more bidders.
   
This program is a great way to understand dictionaries, loops, user input handling, and conditional statements in Python! 🎉💰
